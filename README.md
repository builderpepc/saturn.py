# saturn.py
An async Python API wrapper for [Saturn](https://www.joinsaturn.com/)'s unofficial API, featuring a simple Pythonic syntax and more. Influenced in part by the great [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/).

This project is currently still a work in progress and is not yet installable.

## What is Saturn?
[Saturn](https://www.joinsaturn.com/) is a mobile app that allows high school students to submit their class schedules and automatically be placed in group chats for their classes, among other related features. 

## A Note on Stability
Given that saturn.py does not use an official API, the library may at times break due to changes with Saturn's backend. If you notice a bug, please create an issue.
